#UnitTest #IntegrationTest
Many people, upon hearing “[automated testing](https://www.testim.io/blog/what-are-the-types-of-automation-testing/),” automatically think of unit tests. That’s understandable; after all, unit testing is one of the most well-known types of automated tests. However, it’s far from being the only one. We have UI testing, end-to-end testing, load testing, and that’s just to name a few.

Today’s post—as you can see from the “unit test vs. integration test” in its tile—focuses on two types of automated tests and how they relate to one another.

Here’s the list of topics we’ll be covering:

-   [[Defining Unit Testing]]
-   [[Unit Tests Rules]]
-   [[Why Is Isolation Good for Unit Tests?]]
-   [[Integration Test]]
-   [[Unit Test vs. Integration Test A Summary]]

But that’s not all. Besides covering all of that, we’ll still talk about some adjacent topics. For instance, you’ll know how functional testing plays into the picture. You’ll also understand how unit and integration tests relate to white-box and black-box testing.
