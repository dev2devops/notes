## Control structures

The control structures of Go are related to those of C but differ in important ways. There is no `do` or `while` loop, only a slightly generalized `for`; `switch` is more flexible; `if` and `switch` accept an optional initialization statement like that of `for`; `break` and `continue` statements take an optional label to identify what to break or continue; and there are new control structures including a type switch and a multiway communications multiplexer, `select`. The syntax is also slightly different: there are no parentheses and the bodies must always be brace-delimited.
