#GoLang 
### Examples

The [Go package sources](https://go.dev/src/) are intended to serve not only as the core library but also as examples of how to use the language. Moreover, many of the packages contain working, self-contained executable examples you can run directly from the [golang.org](https://golang.org/) web site, such as [this one](https://go.dev/pkg/strings/#example_Map) (if necessary, click on the word "Example" to open it up). If you have a question about how to approach a problem or how something might be implemented, the documentation, code and examples in the library can provide answers, ideas and background.
