Constants

Constants in Go are just thatâ€”constant. They are created at compile time, even when defined as locals in functions, and can only be numbers, characters (runes), strings or booleans. Because of the compile-time restriction, the expressions that define them must be constant expressions, evaluatable by the compiler. For instance, `1<<3` is a constant expression, while `math.Sin(math.Pi/4)` is not because the function call to `math.Sin` needs to happen at run time.

In Go, enumerated constants are created using the `iota` enumerator. Since `iota` can be part of an expression and expressions can be implicitly repeated, it is easy to build intricate sets of values.

type ByteSize float64

const (
    _           = iota // ignore first value by assigning to blank identifier
    KB ByteSize = 1 << (10 * iota)
    MB
    GB
    TB
    PB
    EB
    ZB
    YB
)

The ability to attach a method such as `String` to any user-defined type makes it possible for arbitrary values to format themselves automatically for printing. Although you'll see it most often applied to structs, this technique is also useful for scalar types such as floating-point types like `ByteSize`.

func (b ByteSize) String() string {
    switch {
    case b >= YB:
        return fmt.Sprintf("%.2fYB", b/YB)
    case b >= ZB:
        return fmt.Sprintf("%.2fZB", b/ZB)
    case b >= EB:
        return fmt.Sprintf("%.2fEB", b/EB)
    case b >= PB:
        return fmt.Sprintf("%.2fPB", b/PB)
    case b >= TB:
        return fmt.Sprintf("%.2fTB", b/TB)
    case b >= GB:
        return fmt.Sprintf("%.2fGB", b/GB)
    case b >= MB:
        return fmt.Sprintf("%.2fMB", b/MB)
    case b >= KB:
        return fmt.Sprintf("%.2fKB", b/KB)
    }
    return fmt.Sprintf("%.2fB", b)
}

The expression `YB` prints as `1.00YB`, while `ByteSize(1e13)` prints as `9.09TB`.

The use here of `Sprintf` to implement `ByteSize`'s `String` method is safe (avoids recurring indefinitely) not because of a conversion but because it calls `Sprintf` with `%f`, which is not a string format: `Sprintf` will only call the `String` method when it wants a string, and `%f` wants a floating-point value.
