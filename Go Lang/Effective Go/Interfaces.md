**Interfaces**

Interfaces in Go provide a way to specify the behavior of an object: if something can do _this_, then it can be used _here_. We've seen a couple of simple examples already; custom printers can be implemented by a `String` method while `Fprintf` can generate output to anything with a `Write` method. Interfaces with only one or two methods are common in Go code, and are usually given a name derived from the method, such as `io.Writer` for something that implements `Write`.

A type can implement multiple interfaces. For instance, a collection can be sorted by the routines in package `sort` if it implements `sort.Interface`, which contains `Len()`, `Less(i, j int) bool`, and `Swap(i, j int)`, and it could also have a custom formatter. In this contrived example `Sequence` satisfies both.

type Sequence []int

// Methods required by sort.Interface.
func (s Sequence) Len() int {
    return len(s)
}
func (s Sequence) Less(i, j int) bool {
    return s[i] < s[j]
}
func (s Sequence) Swap(i, j int) {
    s[i], s[j] = s[j], s[i]
}

// Copy returns a copy of the Sequence.
func (s Sequence) Copy() Sequence {
    copy := make(Sequence, 0, len(s))
    return append(copy, s...)
}

// Method for printing - sorts the elements before printing.
func (s Sequence) String() string {
    s = s.Copy() // Make a copy; don't overwrite argument.
    sort.Sort(s)
    str := "["
    for i, elem := range s { // Loop is O(NÂ²); will fix that in next example.
        if i > 0 {
            str += " "
        }
        str += fmt.Sprint(elem)
    }
    return str + "]"
}
