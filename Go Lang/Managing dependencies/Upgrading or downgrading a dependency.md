## Upgrading or downgrading a dependency

You can upgrade or downgrade a dependency module by using Go tools to discover available versions, then add a different version as a dependency.

1.  To discover new versions use the `go list` command as described in [Discovering available updates](https://go.dev/doc/modules/managing-dependencies#discovering_updates).
    
2.  To add a particular version as a dependency, use the `go get` command as described in [Getting a specific dependency version](https://go.dev/doc/modules/managing-dependencies#getting_version).
