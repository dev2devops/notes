### Failing input

A failure may occur while fuzzing for several reasons:

-   A panic occurred in the code or the test.
-   The fuzz target called `t.Fail`, either directly or through methods such as `t.Error` or `t.Fatal`.
-   A non-recoverable error occured, such as an `os.Exit` or stack overflow.
-   The fuzz target took too long to complete. Currently, the timeout for an execution of a fuzz target is 1 second. This may fail due to a deadlock or infinite loop, or from intended behavior in the code. This is one reason why it is [suggested that your fuzz target be fast](https://go.dev/doc/fuzz/#suggestions).

If an error occurs, the fuzzing engine will attempt to minimize the input to the smallest possible and most human readable value which will still produce an error. To configure this, see the [custom settings](https://go.dev/doc/fuzz/#custom-settings) section.

Once minimization is complete, the error message will be logged, and the output will end with something like this:

```
    Failing input written to testdata/fuzz/FuzzFoo/a878c3134fe0404d44eb1e662e5d8d4a24beb05c3d68354903670ff65513ff49
    To re-run:
    go test -run=FuzzFoo/a878c3134fe0404d44eb1e662e5d8d4a24beb05c3d68354903670ff65513ff49
FAIL
exit status 1
FAIL    foo 0.839s
```

The fuzzing engine wrote this [failing input](https://go.dev/doc/fuzz/#glos-failing-input) to the seed corpus for that fuzz test, and it will now be run by default with `go test`, serving as a regression test once the bug has been fixed.

The next step for you will be to diagnose the problem, fix the bug, verify the fix by re-running `go test`, and submit the patch with the new testdata file acting as your regression test.
