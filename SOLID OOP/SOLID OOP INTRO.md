#SolidOOP
The SOLID Principles are five principles of Object-Oriented class design. They are a set of rules and best practices to follow while designing a class structure.

These five principles help us understand the need for certain design patterns and software architecture in general. So I believe that it is a topic that every developer should learn.

This article will teach you everything you need to know to apply SOLID principles to your projects.

We will start by taking a look into the history of this term. Then we are going to get into the nitty-gritty details – the why's and how's of each principle – by creating a class design and improving it step by step.

The SOLID principles were first introduced by the famous Computer Scientist Robert J. Martin (a.k.a Uncle Bob) in his [paper](https://fi.ort.edu.uy/innovaportal/file/2032/1/design_principles.pdf) in 2000. But the SOLID acronym was introduced later by Michael Feathers.

Let's look at each principle one by one. Following the SOLID acronym, they are:

* *[[The Single Responsibility Principle]]
- [[Open-Closed Principle]]
- [[Liskov Substitution Principle]]
- [[Interface Segregation Principle]]
- [[Dependency Inversion Principle]]
