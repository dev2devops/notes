# Develop with Docker

This page contains a list of resources for application developers who would like to build new applications using Docker.

## Prerequisites[](https://docs.docker.com/develop/#prerequisites)

Work through the learning modules in [Get started](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) to understand how to build an image and run it as a containerized application.

## Develop new apps on Docker[](https://docs.docker.com/develop/#develop-new-apps-on-docker)

If youâ€™re just getting started developing a brand new app on Docker, check out these resources to understand some of the most common patterns for getting the most benefits from Docker.

-   Use [multi-stage builds](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/) to keep your images lean
-   Manage application data using [volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) and [bind mounts](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/)
-   [Scale your app with Kubernetes](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/kube-deploy/)
-   [Scale your app as a Swarm service](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/swarm-deploy/)
-   [General application development best practices](https://docs.docker.com/develop/dev-best-practices/)

## Learn about language-specific app development with Docker[](https://docs.docker.com/develop/#learn-about-language-specific-app-development-with-docker)

-   [Docker for Java developers lab](https://github.com/docker/labs/tree/master/developer-tools/java/)
-   [Port a node.js app to Docker lab](https://github.com/docker/labs/tree/master/developer-tools/nodejs/porting)
-   [Ruby on Rails app on Docker lab](https://github.com/docker/labs/tree/master/developer-tools/ruby)
-   [Dockerize a .Net Core application](https://docs.docker.com/samples/dotnetcore/)
-   [Dockerize an ASP.NET Core application with SQL Server on Linux](https://docs.docker.com/samples/aspnet-mssql-compose/) using Docker Compose

## Advanced development with the SDK or API[](https://docs.docker.com/develop/#advanced-development-with-the-sdk-or-api)

After you can write Dockerfiles or Compose files and use Docker CLI, take it to the next level by using Docker Engine SDK for Go/Python or use the HTTP API directly. Visit the [Develop with Docker Engine API](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/) section to learn more about developing with the Engine API, where to find SDKs for your programming language of choice, and to see some examples.
