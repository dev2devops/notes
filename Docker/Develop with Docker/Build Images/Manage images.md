#Docker 
# Manage images
The easiest way to make your images available for use by others inside or outside your organization is to use a Docker registry, such as [Docker Hub](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/image_management/#docker-hub), or by running your own [private registry](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/image_management/#docker-registry).

## Docker Hub[](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/image_management/#docker-hub)

[Docker Hub](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/) is a public registry managed by Docker, Inc. It centralizes information about organizations, user accounts, and images. It includes a web UI, authentication and authorization using organizations, CLI and API access using commands such as `docker login`, `docker pull`, and `docker push`, comments, stars, search, and more.

## Docker Registry[](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/image_management/#docker-registry)

The Docker Registry is a component of Dockerâ€™s ecosystem. A registry is a storage and content delivery system, holding named Docker images, available in different tagged versions. For example, the image `distribution/registry`, with tags `2.0` and `latest`. Users interact with a registry by using docker push and pull commands such as `docker pull myregistry.com/stevvooe/batman:voice`.

Docker Hub is an instance of a Docker Registry.

## Content Trust[](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/image_management/#content-trust)

When transferring data among networked systems, _trust_ is a central concern. In particular, when communicating over an untrusted medium such as the internet, it is critical to ensure the integrity and publisher of all of the data a system operates on. You use Docker to push and pull images (data) to a registry. Content trust gives you the ability to both verify the integrity and the publisher of all the data received from a registry over any channel.

See [Content trust](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/trust/) for information about configuring and using this feature on Docker clients.
