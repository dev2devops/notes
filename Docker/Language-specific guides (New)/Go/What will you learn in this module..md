# What will you learn in this module?
In this guide, you will learn how to create a containerized Go application using Docker.

Why [Go](https://golang.org/)? Go is an open-source programming language that lets you build simple, reliable, and efficient software. Go is undeniably a major player in the modern Cloud ecosystem; both Docker and Kubernetes are written in Go.

In this guide, you’ll learn how to:

-   Create a new `Dockerfile` which contains instructions required to build a Docker image for a simple Go program
-   Run the newly built image as a container
-   Set up a local development environment to connect a database to the container
-   Use Docker Compose to run your Go application and other services it requires
-   Configure a CI/CD pipeline for your application using [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)

You can containerize your own Go application using the examples and resources provided after you complete the Go getting started modules.
