**Minimum Viable Product**
 
A minimum viable product in the software sense is code that is stripped from all features to focus on the core functionality.

**How to MVP?**
-   Formulate hypothesis
    
-   Omit needless features
    
-   Split test to validate each new feature
    
-   Focus on product-market fit
    
-   Seek high-value and low-cost features
