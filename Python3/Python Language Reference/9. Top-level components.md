# 9. Top-level components

The Python interpreter can get its input from a number of sources: from a script passed to it as standard input or as program argument, typed in interactively, from a module source file, etc. This chapter gives the syntax used in these cases.

## 9.1. Complete Python programs[](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/toplevel_components.html#complete-python-programs "Permalink to this headline")

While a language specification need not prescribe how the language interpreter is invoked, it is useful to have a notion of a complete Python program. A complete Python program is executed in a minimally initialized environment: all built-in and standard modules are available, but none have been initialized, except for [`sys`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#module-sys "sys: Access system-specific parameters and functions.") (various system services), [`builtins`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/builtins.html#module-builtins "builtins: The module that provides the built-in namespace.") (built-in functions, exceptions and `None`) and [`__main__`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html#module-__main__ "__main__: The environment where top-level code is run. Covers command-line interfaces, import-time behavior, and ``__name__ == '__main__'``."). The latter is used to provide the local and global namespace for execution of the complete program.

The syntax for a complete Python program is that for file input, described in the next section.

The interpreter may also be invoked in interactive mode; in this case, it does not read and execute a complete program but reads and executes one statement (possibly compound) at a time. The initial environment is identical to that of a complete program; each statement is executed in the namespace of [`__main__`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html#module-__main__ "__main__: The environment where top-level code is run. Covers command-line interfaces, import-time behavior, and ``__name__ == '__main__'``.").

A complete program can be passed to the interpreter in three forms: with the [`-c`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-c) _string_ command line option, as a file passed as the first command line argument, or as standard input. If the file or standard input is a tty device, the interpreter enters interactive mode; otherwise, it executes the file as a complete program.

## 9.2. File input[](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/toplevel_components.html#file-input "Permalink to this headline")

All input read from non-interactive files has the same form:

**file_input** ::=  (NEWLINE | [`statement`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-statement))*

This syntax is used in the following situations:

-   when parsing a complete Python program (from a file or from a string);
    
-   when parsing a module;
    
-   when parsing a string passed to the [`exec()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#exec "exec") function;
    

## 9.3. Interactive input[](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/toplevel_components.html#interactive-input "Permalink to this headline")

Input in interactive mode is parsed using the following grammar:

**interactive_input** ::=  [[`stmt_list`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-stmt_list)] NEWLINE | [`compound_stmt`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-compound_stmt) NEWLINE

Note that a (top-level) compound statement must be followed by a blank line in interactive mode; this is needed to help the parser detect the end of the input.

## 9.4. Expression input[](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/toplevel_components.html#expression-input "Permalink to this headline")

[`eval()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#eval "eval") is used for expression input. It ignores leading whitespace. The string argument to [`eval()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#eval "eval") must have the following form:

**eval_input** ::=  [`expression_list`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-expression_list) NEWLINE*
